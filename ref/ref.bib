	abstract = {High ionic conductivity is a prerequisite requirement for materials used in monovalent metal-ion rechargeable batteries. The extensive search of new electrode materials for Na-ion and K-ion monovalent metal-ion batteries requires a deep understanding of structural and chemical details of cation migration through the crystal lattice. In the paper, we consider three classes of transition metal oxide and phosphate cathode materials: AMn2O4 spinels, AMPO4 olivines and AVPO4F tavorites (A = Li, Na, K, □; M = Fe, Mn), used for pragmatic applications for secondary (rechargeable) batteries. Herein we examine Na+ and K+ migration characteristics in comparison with that of Li+ by means of DFT+U, local energy calculations, empirical potentials, and bond valence energy landscape (BVEL). It is found that despite larger radii of Na+ and K+, the migration barriers are comparable with that of Li+. In several cases, we reveal that the migration barrier of K+ can be even lower than that of Li+. This behavior is explained through the interplay of site and lattice energies during cation migration. For automation of screening of migration properties via DFT calculations, a new Python-based framework (SIMAN) is developed and benchmarked across three cathode materials structures.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special `preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

@article{enum_4,
	abstract = {Modeling alloys requires the exploration of all possible configurations of atoms. Additionally, modeling the thermal properties of materials requires knowledge of the possible ways of displacing the atoms. One solution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements is to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those that are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from a combinatorial explosion when the supercell size is large, when there are more than two atom types, or when there are many displaced atoms. This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of unique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an existing algorithm to include the extra configurational degrees of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm uses group theory and a tree-like data structure to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the typical combinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously inaccessible cases, including atomic displacements.},

@article{enum_3,
	abstract = {We present an algorithm for generating derivative superstructures for large unit cells at a fixed concentration. The algorithm is useful when partial crystallographic information of an ordered phase is known. This work builds on the previous work of Hart and Forcade [Phys. Rev. B 77 224115, 2008; Phys. Rev. B 80 014120, 2009]. This extension of the original algorithm provides a mapping from atomic configurations to consecutive integers when only a subset (fixed concentration) of all possible configurations is under consideration. As in the earlier algorithm, this mapping results in a minimal hash table and perfect hash function that enables an efficient method for enumerating the configurations of large unit cells; the run time scales linearly with the number of symmetrically-distinct configurations. We demonstrate the algorithm for a proposed structure in the Ag--Pt system comprising 32 atoms, with stoichiometry 15:17, a configuration space of ∼400,000.},

The 4 $\,^{\circ}$K spectrum is interpreted in the frame of linear spin wave theory with effective exchange integrals J1− = 0·321 meV, J1+ = 0·424 meV, J21 = 0·446 meV and a phenomenological parameter for anisotropy D1 = 0·059 meV. The effect of the actual dipole-dipole Hamiltonian is shown to give a priori a very good account of the lifting of the degeneracy of spin waves near the Brillouin zone center. The Bloch model for interacting spin waves and theories based on Green function approximations have been adapted to the MnO case, in order to compute the main properties (mean magnetization of a sublattice, anisotropic deformation, extra isotropic contraction and magnon spectrum) at many temperatures. Comparison of these with experimental results tends to favour a generalized Callen renormalization model, which gives an overall fit from 4 $\,^{\circ}$K, to temperalures close to TN.},

	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li--Sn--S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {The identification of descriptors of materials properties and functions that capture the underlying physical mechanisms is a critical goal in data-driven materials science. Only such descriptors will enable a trustful and efficient scanning of materials spaces and possibly the discovery of new materials. Recently, the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) has been introduced and was successfully applied to a number of materials-science problems. SISSO is a compressed sensing based methodology yielding predictive models that are expressed in form of analytical formulas, built from simple physical properties. These formulas are systematically selected from an immense number (billions or more) of candidates. In this work, we describe a powerful extension of the methodology to a `multi-task learning' approach, which identifies a single descriptor capturing multiple target materials properties at the same time. This approach is specifically suited for a heterogeneous materials database with scarce or partial data, e.g. in which not all properties are reported for all materials in the training set. As showcase examples, we address the construction of materials properties maps for the relative stability of octet-binary compounds, considering several crystal phases simultaneously, and the metal/insulator classification of binary materials distributed over many crystal prototypes.},

This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies.},

While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for some applications, many more applications exist where machine learning can make a strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based models for such applications, we have created a framework capable of being applied to a broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a chemically diverse list of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide variety of properties, and a novel method for partitioning the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive accuracy. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous materials, such as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.},

	abstract = {Superconductivity has been the focus of enormous research effort since its discovery more than a century ago. Yet, some features of this unique phenomenon remain poorly understood; prime among these is the connection between superconductivity and chemical/structural properties of materials. To bridge the gap, several machine learning schemes are developed herein to model the critical temperatures (Tc) of the 12,000+ known superconductors available via the SuperCon database. Materials are first divided into two classes based on their Tc values, above and below 10 K, and a classification model predicting this label is trained. The model uses coarse-grained features based only on the chemical compositions. It shows strong predictive power, with out-of-sample accuracy of about 92{\%}. Separate regression models are developed to predict the values of Tc for cuprate, iron-based, and low-Tccompounds. These models also demonstrate good performance, with learned predictors offering potential insights into the mechanisms behind superconductivity in different families of materials. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of these models, new features are incorporated using materials data from the AFLOW Online Repositories. Finally, the classification and regression models are combined into a single-integrated pipeline and employed to search the entire Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database (ICSD) for potential new superconductors. We identify >30 non-cuprate and non-iron-based oxides as candidate materials.},

Experiments using regenerator beds composed of three different magnetocaloric materials combined in a layered configuration with applied fields of 2T have produced no-load temperature spans in excess of 50K. The test apparatus uses two active magnetic regenerators each containing approximately 135g of refrigerant. An overview of the test apparatus, operating parameters, and performance is described. The impacts of operation at varying heat rejection temperatures, applied fields of 1.5T and frequencies between 0.65 and 1.0Hz are presented. In addition, the impacts of operating pressure and applied load on temperature spans are discussed.},

@article{OLABI2008,
	abstract = {Magnetostriction is the change in shape of materials under the influence of an external magnetic field. The cause of magnetostriction change in length is the result of the rotation of small magnetic domains. This rotation and re-orientation causes internal strains in the material structure. The strains in the structure lead to the stretching (in the case of positive magnetostriction) of the material in the direction of the magnetic field. During this stretching process the cross-section is reduced in a way that the volume is kept nearly constant. The size of the volume change is so small that it can be neglected under normal operating conditions. Applying a stronger field leads to stronger and more definite re-orientation of more and more domains in the direction of magnetic field. When all the magnetic domains have become aligned with the magnetic field the saturation point has been achieved. This paper presents the state of the art of the magnetostrictive materials and their applications such as: Reaction Mass Actuator, A standard Terfenol-D Actuator, Linear Motor Based on Terfenol-D (Worm Motor), Terfenol-D in Sonar Transducers, Terfenol-D Wireless Rotational Motor, Terfenol-D Electro-Hydraulic Actuator, Wireless Linear Micro-Motor, Magnetostrictive Film Applications, Magnetostrictive Contactless Torque Sensors and many other applications. The study shows that excellent features can be obtained by Magnetostrictive materials for many advanced applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract Magnetocaloric materials with a Curie temperature near room temperature have attracted significant interest for some time due to their possible application for high-efficiency refrigeration devices. This review focuses on a number of key issues of relevance for the characterization, performance and implementation of such materials in actual devices. The phenomenology and fundamental thermodynamics of magnetocaloric materials is discussed, as well as the hysteresis behavior often found in first-order materials. A number of theoretical and experimental approaches and their implications are reviewed. The question of how to evaluate the suitability of a given material for use in a magnetocaloric device is covered in some detail, including a critical assessment of a number of common performance metrics. Of particular interest is which non-magnetocaloric properties need to be considered in this connection. An overview of several important materials classes is given before considering the performance of materials in actual devices. Finally, an outlook on further developments is presented.},

	abstract = {The interest of the scientific community regarding magnetic refrigeration at room temperature is constantly growing. In recent years, there has been an increase in the experimental work relating to both new prototypes and new magnetocaloric materials. The magnetic refrigerators built to date still have some limitations that make them uncompetitive when compared with conventional vapour compression systems. However, among the different configurations realized, one can recognize that rotary devices, having rotating magnets and static regenerators, are of particular interest because of their good energy performances. In this paper, we report an experimental investigation on the identification of the energy performances of a Rotary Permanent Magnet Magnetic Refrigerator. Employing 1.20 kg of gadolinium and operating at a temperature of heat rejection equal to 296 K, the system was subjected to different operating conditions obtained by varying the thermal load, volumetric flow rate of the regenerating fluid and cycle frequency.},

A cross-sectional transmission electron micrograph showed the epitaxial growth of both the upper and lower Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 layers and a MgO barrier and some distortion in the MgO barrier after annealing above 400 $\,^{\circ}$C. An exponential dependence of resistance × area product on MgO barrier thickness was observed. TMR ratio was strongly affected by MgO barrier thickness, exhibiting maxima of 220% at room temperature and 390% at 5 K. The latter corresponds to the spin polarization of 0.81. It was also found that the features of this MTJ include a small asymmetry voltage and weak temperature dependence of its TMR ratio.},

Due to their ubiquity, magnetic materials play an important role in improving the efficiency and performance of devices in electric power generation, conditioning, conversion, transportation, and other energy-use sectors of the economy. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art hard and soft magnets and magnetocaloric materials, with an emphasis on their optimization for energy applications. Specifically, the impact of hard magnets on electric motor and transportation technologies, of soft magnetic materials on electricity generation and conversion technologies, and of magnetocaloric materials for refrigeration technologies, are discussed. The synthesis, characterization, and property evaluation of the materials, with an emphasis on structure--property relationships, are discussed in the context of their respective markets, as well as their potential impact on energy efficiency. Finally, considering future bottlenecks in raw materials, options for the recycling of rare-earth intermetallics for hard magnets will be discussed.},

@article{Lu2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Antiferromagnetic spintronics actively introduces new principles of magnetic memory, in which the most fundamental spin-dependent phenomena, i.e., anisotropic magnetoresistance effects, are governed by an antiferromagnet instead of a ferromagnet. A general scenario of the antiferromagnetic anisotropic magnetoresistance effects mainly stems from the magnetocrystalline anisotropy related to spin--orbit coupling. Here magnetic field driven contour rotation of the fourfold anisotropic magnetoresistance in bare antiferromagnetic Sr2IrO4/SrTiO3 (001) thin films hosting a strong spin--orbit coupling induced Jeff = 1/2 Mott state is demonstrated. Concurrently, an intriguing minimal in the magnetoresistance emerges. Through first principles calculations, the bandgap engineering due to rotation of the Ir isospins is revealed to be responsible for these emergent phenomena, different from the traditional scenario where relatively more conductive state is obtained usually when magnetic field is applied along the magnetic easy axis. These findings demonstrate a new efficient route, i.e., via the novel Jeff = 1/2 state, to realize controllable anisotropic magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic materials.},

	abstract = {Commercial magnetic memories rely on the bistability of ordered spins in ferromagnetic materials. Recently, experimental bistable memories have been realized using fully compensated antiferromagnetic metals. Here we demonstrate a multiple-stable memory device in epitaxial MnTe, an antiferromagnetic counterpart of common II--VI semiconductors. Favourable micromagnetic characteristics of MnTe allow us to demonstrate a smoothly varying zero-field antiferromagnetic anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) with a harmonic angular dependence on the writing magnetic field angle, analogous to ferromagnets. The continuously varying AMR provides means for the electrical read-out of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states, which we set by heat-assisted magneto-recording and by changing the writing field direction. The multiple stability in our memory is ascribed to different distributions of domains with the N{\'e}el vector aligned along one of the three magnetic easy axes. The robustness against strong magnetic field perturbations combined with the multiple stability of the magnetic memory states are unique properties of antiferromagnets.},

	abstract = {The ferromagnetism in many carbon nanostructures is attributed to carbon dangling bonds or vacancies. This provides opportunities to develop new functional materials, such as molecular and polymeric ferromagnets and organic spintronic materials, without magnetic elements (for example, 3d and 4f metals). Here we report the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in Teflon tape (polytetrafluoroethylene) subjected to simple mechanical stretching, cutting or heating. First-principles calculations indicate that the room temperature ferromagnetism originates from carbon dangling bonds and strong ferromagnetic coupling between them. Room temperature ferromagnetism has also been successfully realized in another polymer, polyethylene, through cutting and stretching. Our findings suggest that ferromagnetism due to networks of carbon dangling bonds can arise in polymers and carbon-based molecular materials.},

	abstract = {The long spin diffusion length makes graphene very attractive for novel spintronic devices and thus has triggered a quest for integrating the charge and spin degrees of freedom. However, ideal graphene is intrinsic non-magnetic, due to a delocalized πbonding network. Therefore, synthesis of ferromagnetic graphene or its derivatives with high magnetization is urgent due to both fundamental and technological importance. Here we report that N-doping can be an effective route to obtain a very high magnetization of ca. 1.66 emu/g and can make graphene oxide (GO) to be ferromagnetism with a Curie-temperature of 100.2 K. Clearly, our findings can offer the easy realization of ferromagnetic GO with high magnetization, therefore, push the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.},

@article{Legait2014,
	abstract = {To optimize the performance of an active magnetic regenerative system (AMR), it is important to understand the heat transfer phenomena taking place in the regenerator and the impact of the intrinsic properties of the magnetocaloric material. With this aim in mind, four regenerators involving three different materials (Pr0.65Sr0.35MnO3, La(FeCo)13-xSix, and gadolinium) have been prepared and tested using a permanent magnet based device. This set-up allows studying the performance of different types of regenerators over a wide range of fluidic and magnetic operating conditions. However, since no thermal exchanger is used, this device provides only non-load temperature spans. First, this work deals with an analysis of the performance of the regenerators as a function of their utilization ratio (i.e. working conditions such as the mass flow rate and frequency). Then, an attempt is made to correlate the performance of each regenerator with the physical properties of these different materials.},

The electronic states and magnetic properties are calculated using the first-principles self-consistent Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function method combined with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). Some of the calculated properties of ZB type materials (Al1−xMx)Sb and (Ga1−xMx)As exhibit stable ferromagnetic (FM) states relative to a corresponding disorder local moment (DLM) states. The total energy difference between FM and DLM states per unit cell is used to estimate their Curie temperature (TC) within the mean-field approximation. The calculated TC in Mn, and Cr doped cases are found to be above the room temperature (RT), whereas in Ti, and V doped cases TC remain below the RT. In addition, TC increases with doping concentrations in a range of dilute limit (x ≈ 20%) of magnetic atoms. On the other hand, Fe, and Co doped materials exhibit FM instability due to the dominating super-exchange interaction over the FM one.},
